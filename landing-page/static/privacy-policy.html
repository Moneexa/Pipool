                                                    (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help

                                </h3>
                                <p>The influencers and followers whose information we collect are generally over the age
                                    of 18. The websites we use to collect information about influencers and followers
                                    are generally limited to individuals over the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not
                                    proactively collect or share information about children. If we become aware that we
                                    have collected personal information children under the age of 18 without parental or
                                    guardian consent we will delete this information.
                                    If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided personal
                                    information to us, please contact us using the contact information.
