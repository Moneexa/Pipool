There was an alligator living in this swamp, 

sneak up on numbers and start to chomp when they have moved to numbers set on the ground.

She'd face the bigger one, then gobble it down.

When there are two numbers that are the same, the gator changes form and she swaps her name because she

 isn't sure exactly how to dine.

She stands right in the middle, as an equal sign.

 Number gators like to eat What's greater? They turn their backs on

 what is less, their mouths

 open wide and both bigger side,

 and then munch down the whole great mess.
